Welcome!

**Pore-pressure valves** (**PPvalves**) is a python framework to numerically solve the
diffusion of pore-pressure in a 1D channel. PPvalves allows you to distribute
valves along the channel, that open and close according to the pore-pressure
differential they witness. This setup is meant to explore the
interactions between such valves, which can be thought of as an emulation of
seismic tremor elementary sources.
