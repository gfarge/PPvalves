**Pore-pressure valves** (**PPvalves**) is a python framework to numerically solve the diffusion of pore-pressure in a 1D channel. PPvalves allows you to distribute
valves along the channel, that open and close according to the pore-pressure
differential they witness. This setup is meant to explore the
interactions between such valves, which can be thought of as an emulation of
seismic tremor elementary sources.

This package is still being developped. Use at your own risk!
